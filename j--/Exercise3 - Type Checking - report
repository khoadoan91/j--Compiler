Exercise 4.1. The compiler does not enforce the Java rule that only one type declaration 
(that is, class declaration in j--) be declared public. Repair this in one of the analyze() 
methods.

Exercise 4.2. The analyze() method in JVariable assigns the type Type.ANY to a JVariable 
(for example, x) in the AST that has not been declared in the symbol table. This prevents 
a cascading of multiple errors from the report of a single undeclared variable. But we could 
go further by declaring the variable (as Type.ANY) in the symbol table so as to suppress 
superfluous error reports in subsequent encounters of the variable. Make this improvement to analysis.
